**Functions (Effect on game)**  

1. GPWS (Ground Proximity Warning)  
Includes missile warning and other sound-warnings from F16's Bit**ing  
Betty. Gives basic warnings such as: Pull Up, Altitude, Counter, etc.  

2. Realistic Aerodynamics (drag, lift, etc.)  
Brings wind into calculation. Landing speed should be calculated with  
TAS (True Air Speed), not ground speed. In case of crosswinds, de-crab  
or sideslip landings will be required.  

3. ATC (Air Traffic Controller) radar screen  
Shows friendly & civilian planes on map with name, speed, altitude,  
and heading. Useful when commanding multiple planes.  

4. ATIS (Automatic Terminal Information Service)  
Plays ATIS radio boradcast using real in-game atmospheric data. Provides  
wind, visibility, temperature, dewpoint, QNH, etc.
