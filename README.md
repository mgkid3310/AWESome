# AWESome : Aerial Warfare Enhanced Somehow  

Makes ARMA 3's flight environments more realistic (GWPS,  
wind effect, etc.). Recommended to use with ACE since it  
will enable ACE Interaction instead of vanilla actions  
and give more specific weather data on ATIS.  

This addon is SP/MP capable and basically works as a  
client-side mod, and gives some additional features when  
used on both client/server.  

Although this addon is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0,  
feel free to contact me if you need any code from this  
addon for applications.

**Features**  

1. GPWS (Ground Proximity Warning)  

GPWS has two modes: F-16 and B747. F-16's Bit**ing Betty  
GPWS includes missile warning and other sound-warnings  
(voice informers). Gives basic warnings such as: Counter;  
Warning; Caution; etc., and is suitable for fighter planes.  
B747's GPWS has more familiar sounds from commercial  
airliners including altitude informers during landing.  
Suitable for large transport or support planes.  
&nbsp;

2. Realistic Aerodynamics (drag, lift, etc.)  

Brings air density and wind into consideration. Air density  
is calulated based on altitude, temperature and humidity.  
This requires landing speed to be set based on TAS (True  
Air Speed), and have air density (altimeter) considered.  
In case of crosswinds, de-crab or sideslip landings will be  
needed. Can enable/disable at addon settings (enabled as  
default), and effects of wind can be adjusted with "Wind  
Multiplier" setting.  
NOTICE : in low-FPS and high-speed situation, this feature  
MAY cause some sutters. if it does so, please temporarily  
disable this feature in addon settings.  
&nbsp;

3. ATC (Air Traffic Controller) radar screen  

Shows friendly & civilian planes on map with name, speed,  
altitude, and heading. Useful when commanding multiple  
planes. Information lines are consisted of the following  
three lines :  
Pilot's Name  
Speed(km/h) Altitude(m)  
Heading(deg)  
&nbsp;

4. ATIS (Automatic Terminal Information Service)  

Plays ATIS radio boradcast using real in-game atmospheric  
data. Provides wind, visibility, etc. Temperature, dew point,  
QFE will ve provided when ACE Weather is enabled.  
With basic settings, ATIS provides real-time data, but with  
addon setting changed, ATIS data should be updated on  
ground  
&nbsp;

5. Ground System  

Provides towing vehicle & system for all planes. Works in MP  
and does not require other players to use this addon for  
towing their planes.  
Offroad vehicles are used as towing cars, and tow planes by  
deploying tow bat via Interaction / Action outside the  
vehicle. Once the tow bar is deployed, place target plane's  
front gear at the end of the tow bar then use Action to  
connect plane to the towbar. After towing around, stop the  
vehicle and disconnect plane using Action.  
NOTICE : moving too fast may occur collisions, so drive with  
caution when towing.
